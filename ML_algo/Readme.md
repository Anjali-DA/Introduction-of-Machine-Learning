## Introduction to Support Vector Machine
- Before starting with SVM, we should take a look on what is Supervised Machine Learning- It is an algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. It finds a hyperplane that creates a boundary between two types of data.
- SVM can only be performed in **binary classiification**.
- For non-linearly separable data we use **Kernalized SVM**
- **Kernel** is a measurement of similarity between the data points. The kernel function in a kernelized SVM tells that given two data points in the original feature space.

### Important parameters in Kernalized SVC
- Kernel
- Gamma and
- The 'C' parameter
