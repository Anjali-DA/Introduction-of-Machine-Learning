# 🧵Classification of ML
## 🔮Two types of classification
**1.** Binary Classification: Categorizing the data into 2 groups
**2.** Multi-class classification: Categorizing the data into more than 2 groups.

## 🔮Types of algorithms
- Linear Classifiers: Logistic Regression
- Tree-Based Classifiers: Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Machines(SVM)
- Artificial Neural Networks
- Bayesian Regression
- Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifiers
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier
- Ensemble Methods: Random Forests, AdaBoost, Bagging Classifier, Voting Classifier, ExtraTrees Classifier

## 🔮Regression techniques
### When to use regression?
A regression problem is when the output variable is a real or continuous value, such as “salary” or “weight”. Many different models/algorithms can be used, the simplest is linear regression.
It tries to fit data with the best hyperplane which goes through the points.

*Hyperplane: is the decison boundries helps to cakssify/categorised the data points.*
