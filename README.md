# Machine-Learning-House-prediction

## üñ•Ô∏èPurpose of this prediction
**1.** Finding & removing the outliers

**2.** Relation between overall quality of the house & Sales Price

**3.** Relation between grade living area & Sales Price

**4.** Relation between Garage area & Sales Price

**5.** Relation between Basement area & Sales Price

**6.** Relation between First floor & Sales Price

**7.** Relation between total bath rooms & Sales Price

**8.** Relation between Total rooms & Sales Price

**9.** Relation between Orignal construction year & Sales Price

**10.** Calculating Mean Absolute Error, Mean Square Error,& Root Mean Square Calculation by Decision Tree Regresion, Random Forest Regressor & Light Gradient Boosting.

## üñ•Ô∏èHow I approched to solve this dataset
üí° **Importing libraries from  for dataframe** 
``` python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
sns.set(style='white', context='notebook', palette='deep')
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina' #set 'png' here when working on notebook
%matplotlib inline
```
**Importing Libraries for machine learning**
``` python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression, LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import metrics
from sklearn import ensemble
from sklearn.utils import shuffle
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
import lightgbm as lgb
```
- Dropping 'Id' from train & test data because it is not necessary for further analysis & prediction.
- Creating/selecting **int** data type columns into train_df & test_df.

## üñ•Ô∏è Finding correlation & outliers

- For finding the correlation I used seaborn **barplot** & **jointplot**.
- To remove the outliers I used drop & reset_index function.

üí° **Relation between Overall house quality and Sales price**

**Output:** 
- In this correlation, Overall quality of the house increases with increase in price
- There are no outliers as both of the features increases proportionally.

üí° **Relation between Ground living area and Sales price**

**Output:**
In this correlation, with increase in ground living area, Sales price also increases but I spotted two points where increase in ground living area, sales price decreases.Hence, There are outliers and I have removed them by using drop function.

*pic-2: correlation without outliers*

üí° **Relation between Garage cars & Sales price**
In this correlation, with increase in garage capacity, sales price also increases, but I spotted a bar where garage capacity increases with decrease in sales price which doesn't seem fit in this analysis.
