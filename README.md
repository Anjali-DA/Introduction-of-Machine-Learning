# Understanding of Machine Learning 

## 🖥️Why Machine learning?
Starting Machine Learning, the dataset goes through seven stages:
**1.** Question or problem defination
**2** Acquire training and testing dataset
**3** Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.
**4** Analyze, identify patterns and explore the data.
**5** Model, predict and solve the problem.
**6.** Visualize, report and present the problem solving steps and final solution.
