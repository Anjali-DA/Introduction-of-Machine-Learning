# Getting started with Machine Learning 
## What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables self-learning from data and then applies that learning without the need for human intervention.

In Machine learning, algorithms are used to predic, get the accuracy score & plot the data points.

## ðŸ¤– How does Machine learning works?
Starting Machine Learning, the dataset goes through seven stages:
Question or problem defination
Acquire training and testing dataset
Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.
Analyze, identify patterns and explore the data.
Model, predict and solve the problem.
Visualize, report and present the problem solving steps and final solution.
